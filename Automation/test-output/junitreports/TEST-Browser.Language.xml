If you want to start learning Spanish from the bottom up, you’ve come to the right place! Lawless Spanish for Beginners is a self-study course divided into 30 loosely themed units consisting of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation lessons; cultural tips; and assorted listening exercises and quizzes along the way. Keep reading for some info and advice on making the most of this course, or go straight to the lessons.
How to learn Spanish
Each unit is in the form of a checklist with links to online lessons and other resources. I recommend spending at least a week but no more than a month on each unit: study/practice each item in the list and then go back through them again more quickly to cement your learning before moving on to the next unit. And of course you can go back to an earlier unit any time you like.
Practice is essential
Studying is just the first step – you have to practice what you’re learning as much as possible. As a beginner, you might not feel comfortable diving into conversations with native speakers, so how about an AI chatbot? It speaks and understands like a native speaker, but it never gets bored!
Getting serious
If your self study isn’t going fast enough for you, consider hiring a Spanish tutor. They’ll be able to work with you to concentrate on exactly what you want to learn and what you have the most trouble with.
Are you really a beginner?
If you’re not an absolute beginner, I recommend you take this free proficiency test in order to figure out where you are: Progress with Lawless Spanish. After creating your free account and taking the placement test, you’ll receive a level assessment and personalized study plan.
Also try Hotel Borbollón – this fun program uses comics and videos to tell the story of Ana Borbollón, a doctor who must choose between her career in Buenos Aires and her family’s hotel in Madrid.
